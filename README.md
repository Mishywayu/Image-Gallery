# Learning Greensock Animation Platform (GSAP)
First of all, I was today years old when I learnt there is something called a grid generator. The simplest and most helpful tool ever.

Day 1 of learning GSAP, I started out with this image grid with flip effect. When you click an image it changes it's position and goes to the 'big' grid space.

I used HTML, CSS and JavaScript.
